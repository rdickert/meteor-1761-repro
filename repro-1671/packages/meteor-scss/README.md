meteor-scss
===========

Node-sass wrapped to work with meteor.

This allows .scss files to work with meteor - N.B. node-sass only supports scss files, so apologies to those who want sass support, this package will not help you.

To use:
This package is configured to find *.scss files and compile them through node-sass and provide them to the page. So just start using it, the scss files can be anywhere in the project.
